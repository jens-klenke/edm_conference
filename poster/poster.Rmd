, with the intent to compare the outcomes of an unproctored exam ($N=151$) during the COVID-19 pandemic with a proctored exam ($N=109$) held in-person before the pandemic.
* The two groups' exams involved solving arithmetical problems, completing R programming tasks, and writing a short essay. During the exam process, student activities and time stamps were tracked in event logs, and the points achieved for each task were recorded.
* The dataset was cleaned to ensure comparability by removing students with minimal participation or achievement, as well as those who encountered internet issues.

* $D(x_i, x_{i'})$ is the global pairwise dissimilarity, while $d_j(x_{ij}, x_{i'j})$ denotes the pairwise attribute dissimilarity. The weights $w_j$ sum up to 1. Index $i$ denotes the number of Students $i = 1, ..., N$ with $N = 151$ students, while $j$ is the index for each of the $h$ attributes.
* We compared two different kinds of attributes, namely the dissimilarities in the studentÂ´s event patters (time of submission) defined as $d_j^L(v_{ij}, v_{i'j})$ and the dissimilarities in points achieved $d_j^P(s_{ij}, s_{i'j})$.

# Setting

* Data from the *Descriptive Statistics* course at the U Duisburg-Essen, Germany
* Exams consist of arithmetical problems, programming tasks in `R`, and a short essay task
* Both exams are conducted digitally with the e-assessment system [JACK](https://www.uni-due.de/zim/services/jack.php)
  * Each student receives different randomized numerical values across all tasks
  * Event logs capture students' activities, time stamps, and points during the exams for every subtask

```{r table, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

groups <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here('resources/groups.xlsx'))

* The test group took the unproctored exam at home during the pandemic
  * The comparison group took a proctored exam in the facilities of the university
* Data cleaning is conducted, removing students with minimal participation or achievement and students with internet problems

# Methodology

* The study utilized an agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering  algorithm that can be described by following equation:


$$D(s_i, s_{i'}, v_i, v_{i'}) = \frac{1}{h} \sum_{j=1}^h (w_j^P \cdot d_j^P (s_{ij}, s_{i'j}) + w_j^L \cdot d_j^L (v_{ij}, v_{i'j}))$$

<ul> 
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> \(D(s_i, s_{i'}, v_i, v_{i'})\) the global pairwise dissimilarity </li>
      <li> \(d_j^P(s_{ij}, s_{i'j})\) points dissimilarity for each task \(j\) </li>
      <li> \(d_j^L(v_{ij}, v_{i'j})\) students event patterns dissimilarity for each task \(j\) </li>
      <li> \(\sum_{j=1}^h w_j^P + w_j^L =1\) weight of each attribute \( h\) </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

* We reduce the weights for 
  + `R`-tasks, as these tasks have more noise 
  + Essay questions, as the comparison on that kind of task are limited 
  + Points achieved

* Dissimilarities in points achieved for each task $j$ 

$$d_j^P(s_{ij}, s_{i'j}) = |  s_{ij} - s_{i'j} |$$

<ul> 
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> \(s_{ij}\) denotes the points achieved by student \(i\) in the \(j\)-th subtask </li>
      <li> Manhatten metric </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

* Dissimilarities in the students event patterns (time of submission) for each task $j$  

$$d_j^L(v_{ij}, v_{i'j}) = \sum_{m=1}^{K=70} | v_{ijm} - v_{i'jm} |$$

<ul> 
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> \(d_j^L(v_{ij}, v_{i'j})\) students event patterns dissimilarity for each task \(j\)</li>
      <li> Examination is divided into \(m = 1, ... , 70\) time intervals </li>
      <li> \(v_{ijm}\) denotes the number of answers of student \(i\) for task \(j\) in the \(m\)-th interval </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>


# Empirical Results

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Dendogram produced by average linkage clustering of the unproctored test group (2020/21). <strong> A-F </strong> mark the clusters with the lowest dissimilarity."), echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here('resources/graphics/dendogram_new.png'))

```

* Figure 1 shows the dendrogram of the **test** group
  * Overall a lower level of dissimilarity compared to the comparison group
  * Six clusters (<strong>A-F</strong>) standing out noticeably from the rest of the cohort

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Eevent logs and achieved points of the cluster <strong>B</strong> from the test group (2020/21). Above the scatter plot, a bar chart is added to compare the points per subtask."), echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here('resources/graphics/plot_b_poster.svg'))
```

* Figure 2 illustrates the individual comparison of achieved points and event logs of the student cluster with the highest similarity
  * Similar time path and same points for each task 

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Comparison of the  normalised distance measures."), echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here('resources/graphics/boxplot_norm_marked_poster.png'))

```

* Figure 3 compares the normalized distributions of the dissimilarity measures between the comparison and test groups

# Discussion

* Three notable clusters (**A**, **B**, and **E**) consisting of two students each
* Collusion in larger groups are not found
* Findings the same with other linkage methods and parameter specifications as weightings
* The approach provides a basis for the examination of clusters based on comparison with a reference group



```{r, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
* The study discusses the results of hierarchical clustering algorithms, visually represented via a dendrogram, a tree-like structure.
* Various clustering algorithms were compared, and average linkage clustering was found to be the most suitable for the analysis.
* The use of average linkage clustering helped identify compact clusters (specifically clusters **A**, **B**, and **E**), suggesting a lack of large group collusion.
* Additional visual tools like scatterplots and bar charts were employed to examine similarities among students within these clusters.
* The study used a reference group for comparison, validating the method's effectiveness in detecting collusion, though limitations exist due to unknown ground truth.
* The approach not only aids in deterring cheating in unproctored exams but also contributes to the broader digital transformation of education, equipping us to handle unforeseen future challenges similar to the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Further Research

* Long-term efficacy of the collusion detection method during exams and its impact on academic integrity and student behavior
* Refining methods for gathering and analyzing supplementary evidence

* The elevated risk of detection may indeed discourage students from cheating in unproctored exams
