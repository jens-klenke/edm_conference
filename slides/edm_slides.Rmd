<h1> Introduction </h1>

* COVID-19 forced universities to switch to online classes and exams.
* Proctoring online exams with video conference software was often prohibited due to data protection regulations and economically unfeasible.
* In this case study take-home exams were conducted as open-book, but collaboration was strictly prohibited.
* Hierarchical clustering algorithms were used to identify groups of potentially colluding students.
* The method successfully found groups with nearly identical exams.
* A proctored comparison group helped categorize student groups as "outstandingly similar".



```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

test1 <- Citet(my_bib, 'cleophas2021s', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))
test2 <- Citet(my_bib, 'Hellas_2017', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))
test3 <- Citet(my_bib, 'Leinonen_2016', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))
test4 <- Citet(my_bib, 'hemming2010online', .opts = list("max.names" = 2))
test5 <- Citet(my_bib, 'hollister2009proctored', .opts = list("max.names" = 2))


```

name: related_work

<h1> Related work </h1>

* Limited research exists on unproctored exams at universities prior to the pandemic.
* `r Citet(my_bib, 'cleophas2021s', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))` propose a method using event logs to detect collusion in unproctored exams.
* Previous studies focused on similarity measures for programming exams based on keyboard patterns, e.g. `r Citet(my_bib, 'Hellas_2017', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))` and `r Citet(my_bib, 'Leinonen_2016', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))`.
* Other literature (e.g. `r Citet(my_bib, 'hemming2010online', .opts = list("max.names" = 2))`) relies on surveys or interviews, lacking actual student behavior data on collusion.
* Some studies suggest that unsupervised online exams may lead to collusion.
* `r Citet(my_bib, 'hollister2009proctored', .opts = list("max.names" = 2))` used GPA and final exam scores to analyze collusion but not data collected during the exam.

name: methodology

<h1> Methodology — <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"> Model </span> </h1>

* Data for the study was collected from the *Descriptive Statistics* course at the University Duisburg-Essen, Germany.
* The test group took the unproctored exam at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the comparison group took a proctored exam in class before the pandemic.
* The exams consisted of arithmetical problems, programming tasks in `R`, and a short essay task.
* Event logs captured students' activities and time stamps during the exams, and points achieved per task were recorded.
* Data cleaning was conducted, removing students with minimal participation or achievement, as well as those with reported internet problems.
* Despite differences in exam format, both groups shared similar content and learning goals, with opportunities for questions and discussions.

<h1> Methodology — <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"> Model </span> </h1>

* Agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering algorithm
* Global pairwise dissimilarities

$$D(x_i, x_{i'}) = \frac{1}{h} \sum_{j=1}^h w_j \cdot d_j(x_{ij}, x_{i'j}) \quad with \quad \sum_{j=1}^h w_j = 1$$
* $D(x_i, x_{i'})$: Global pairwise dissimilarity
* $d_j(x_{ij}, x_{i'j})$: Pairwise attribute dissimilarity
* $i = 1, ..., N$ with $N = 151$ students
* $j = 1, ..., h$ attributes
* We compared two different kinds of attributes:
  * Dissimilarities in the student´s event patters (time of submission)
  * Dissimilarities in points achieved
  
---

<h1> Methodology — <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"> Model </span> </h1>

### Dissimilarities in the student´s event patters (time of submission)

* $d_j^L(v_{ij}, v_{i'j})$ with weights $w_j^L$
* We divided the examination into $m = 1, ... , 70$ intervals, since both exams took $70$ min.
* $v_{ijm}$ denotes the count of answers of student $i$ during the $m$-th interval.
* Manhatten metric used for calculation of the pairwise attribute dissimilarity.

$\quad$
  
$$d_j^L(v_{ij}, v_{i'j}) = \sum_{m=1}^{K=70} | v_{ijm} - v_{i'jm} |$$
  
---
  
<h1> Methodology — <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"> Model </span> </h1>
  
### Dissimilarities in points achieved

* $d_j^P(s_{ij}, s_{i'j})$ with weights $w_j^P$
* $s_{ij}$ denotes the points achieved by student $i$ in the $j$-th sub task.
* Absolute difference used as dissimilarity measure.

$\quad$
  
$$d_j^P(s_{ij}, s_{i'j}) = |  s_{ij} - s_{i'j} |$$


---

<h1> Methodology — <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"> Model </span> </h1>



### Full model

$$D(s_i, s_{i'}, v_i, v_{i'}) = \frac{1}{h} \sum_{j=1}^h (w_j^P \cdot d_j^P (s_{ij}, s_{i'j}) + w_j^L \cdot d_j^L (v_{ij}, v_{i'j}))
\quad \text{with} \quad \sum_{j=1}^h w_j^P + w_j^L =1$$

* Weights $w_j$ control the influence each attribute on the global object dissimilarity.
* We reduced the weights for: 
  * `R`-tasks and free-text questions, since the event log might not be comparable in these cases
  * Points achieved
* Since dissimilarity measures depend on scale, the attributes were normalized.

<h1> Discussion </h1>

* The results of hierarchical clustering algorithms are presented in a dendrogram, providing a visual representation of the clustering results.
* A dendrogram resembles a tree structure, where objects are merged based on their dissimilarity in a bottom-up approach.
* Various hierarchical clustering algorithms exist, and the cophenetic correlation coefficient is used to assess how well each algorithm represents the original structure in the data.
* Average linkage clustering is deemed the most suitable algorithm for the analysis.
* The dendrogram shows compact clusters at medium dissimilarities, with three notable clusters (**A**, **B**, and **E**) consisting of two students each, indicating the absence of collusion in larger groups.
* Scatterplots and barcharts are used to examine the similarity of students' chronology and achieved points within clusters.


---
name: discussion
<h1> Discussion </h1>

* Comparison with the results from the comparison group supports the findings, indicating that collusion over the entire exam is unlikely, and the differences between the groups are not coincidental.
* The method successfully detects at least three clusters with near identical exams.
* The approach provides a basis for further examination of clusters based on comparison with a reference group, but the ground truth is not known, limiting the certainty of conclusions.
* Nevertheless, the elevated risk of detection may indeed discourage students from cheating in unproctored exams. 
* This is not only a important step in adapting to the progressing digitization of education, but it also equips us better for unforeseen situations in the future, much like the COVID-19 pandemic.



---

<h1> Further research </h1>

* Exploring the long-term effectiveness of the detection method in deterring students from colluding in exams, and its impact on academic integrity and student behavior.
* Development and implementation of methods to collect and analyze complementary evidence, with the aim of improving detection rates and understanding the extent of collusion among students.
