# Introduction

* COVID-19 forced universities to switch to online classes and exams.
* Proctoring online exams with video conference software was often prohibited due to data protection regulations.
* Take-home exams were conducted as open-book, but collaboration was strictly prohibited.
* Hierarchical clustering algorithms were used to identify groups of potentially colluding students.
* The method successfully found groups with nearly identical exams.
* A proctored comparison group helped categorize student groups as "outstandingly similar".

# Related work

* Limited research exists on unproctored exams at universities prior to the pandemic.
* `r Citet(my_bib, 'cleophas2021s', .opts = list(max.names = 2))` propose a method using event logs to detect collusion in unproctored exams.
* Previous studies focused on similarity measures for programming exams based on keyboard patterns.
* Other literature relies on surveys or interviews, lacking actual student behavior data on collusion.
* Various proctoring options exist for take-home exams, but they can be costly or prohibited by law.
* Some studies suggest that unsupervised online exams may lead to collusion.
* GPA and final exam scores have been used to analyze collusion but not data collected during the exam.

# Methodology - Data set

* Data for the study was collected from the "Descriptive Statistics" course at the University Duisburg-Essen, Germany.
* The test group took the unproctored exam during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the comparison group took a proctored exam before the pandemic.
* The exams consisted of arithmetical problems, programming tasks in R, and a short essay task.
* Event logs captured students' activities and timestamps during the exams, and points achieved per task were recorded.
* Data cleaning was conducted, removing students with minimal participation or achievement, as well as those with reported internet problems.
* Despite differences in exam format, both groups shared similar content and learning goals, with opportunities for questions and discussions.

# Methodology - Model

* agglomerative (botto-up) hierachical clusteirng algorithm
* global pairwise dissimilarities

$$D(x_i, x_{i'}) = \frac{1}{h} \sum_{j=1}^h w_j \cdot d_j(x_{ij}, x_{i'j}) \quad with \quad \sum_{j=1}^h w_j = 1$$
* $D(x_i, x_{i'})$: global pairwise dissimilarite
* $d_j(x_{ij}, x_{i'j})$: pairwise attribute dissimilarity
* $i = 1, ..., N$ with N = 151 students
* $j = 1, ..., h$ attributes
* We compared two different kinds of attributes:
  * dissimilarities in the student´s event patters (time of submission)
  * dissimilarities in points achieved
  
---

# Methodology - Model

### dissimilarities in the student´s event patters (time of submission)

* $d_j^L(v_{ij}, v_{i'j})$ with weights $w_j^L$
* We divided the examination into m = 1, ... , 70 interval, since both exams took 70 min
* $v_{ijm}$ denotes the count of answers of student $i$ during the $m$th interval
* Manhatten metric used for calculation of the pairwise attribute dissimilarity
  
  
$$d_j^L(v_{ij}, v_{i'j}) = \sum_{m=1}^{K=70} | v_{ijm} - v_{i'jm} |$$
  
---
  
# Methodology - Model  
  
### dissimilarities in points achieved

* $d_j^P(s_{ij}, s_{i'j})$ with weights $w_j^P$
* $s_{ij}$ denotes the points achieved by student $i$ in the $j$th subtask
* absolute diffrenced used as dissimilarity measure
  
  
$$d_j^P(s_{ij}, s_{i'j}) = |  s_{ij} - s_{i'j} |$$


---

# Methodology - Model 

### Full model

$$D(s_i, s_{i'}, v_i, v_{i'}) = \frac{1}{h} \sum_{j=1}^h (w_j^P \cdot d_j^P (s_{ij}, s_{i'j}) + w_j^L \cdot d_j^L (v_{ij}, v_{i'j}))$$
with $$\sum_{j=1}^h w_j^P + w_j^L =1$$

* weights $w_j$ control the influence each attribute on the global object dissimilarity
* we reduced the weights for 
  * R-tasks and free-text questions, since the event log might not be comparable in these cases
  * points achieved
* Since dissimilarity measures depend on scale, the attributes were normalized

# Summary

* The results of hierarchical clustering algorithms are presented in a dendrogram, providing a visual representation of the clustering results.
* A dendrogram resembles a tree structure, where objects are merged based on their dissimilarity in a bottom-up approach.
* Various hierarchical clustering algorithms exist, and the cophenetic correlation coefficient is used to assess how well each algorithm represents the original structure in the data.
* Average linkage clustering is deemed the most suitable algorithm for the analysis.
* The dendrogram shows compact clusters at medium dissimilarities, with three notable clusters (A, B, and E) consisting of two students each, indicating the absence of collusion in larger groups.
* Scatterplots and barcharts are used to examine the similarity of students' chronology and achieved points within clusters.
* Comparison with the results from the comparison group supports the findings, indicating that collusion over the entire exam is unlikely, and the differences between the groups are not coincidental.

name: discussion
# Discussion

* The method successfully detects at least three clusters with near identical exams.
* The approach provides a basis for further examination of clusters based on comparison with a reference group, but the ground truth is not known, limiting the certainty of conclusions.
