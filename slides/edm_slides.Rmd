# Introduction

* COVID-19 forced universities to switch to online exams
* Proctoring online exams with video conference software was prohibited by our university
* We conducted take-home exams as open-book, but collaboration was prohibited
* Hierarchical clustering algorithms are used to identify groups of potentially colluding students
* The method successfully finds groups with similar behavior in the exams
* A proctored comparison group helps categorize students as _uncommonly similar_ 
  * We used the data from the last time we offered the course

<!-- outstandingly, Paper wording? -->


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

test1 <- Citet(my_bib, 'cleophas2021s', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))
test2 <- Citet(my_bib, 'Hellas_2017', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))
test3 <- Citet(my_bib, 'Leinonen_2016', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))
test4 <- Citet(my_bib, 'hemming2010online', .opts = list("max.names" = 2))

* Limited research exists on unproctored exams at universities 

<!-- prior to the pandemic --> 

* `r Citet(my_bib, 'cleophas2021s', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))` propose a method using event logs to detect collusion in unproctored exams
* Previous studies focused on similarity measures for programming exams based on keyboard patterns, e.g. `r Citet(my_bib, 'Hellas_2017', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))` and `r Citet(my_bib, 'Leinonen_2016', .opts = list("max.names" = 1))`
* Other literature (e.g. `r Citet(my_bib, 'hemming2010online', .opts = list("max.names" = 2))`) relies on surveys or interviews, lacking actual student behavior data on collusion
* Some studies suggest that unsupervised online exams may lead to collusion
* `r Citet(my_bib, 'hollister2009proctored', .opts = list("max.names" = 2))` used GPA and final exam scores to analyze collusion, but no data was collected during the exam

<h1> Methodology — <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"> Set-up </span> </h1>

* Data for the study are collected from the *Descriptive Statistics* course at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany
* The exams consist of arithmetical problems, programming tasks in `R`, and a short essay task
* Both exams are conducted digitally with the e-assessment system [JACK](https://www.uni-due.de/zim/services/jack.php) 
  - Each student receives different randomized numerical values across all tasks
  - Event logs capture students' activities, time stamps, and points during the exams for every subtask
* The test group took the unproctored exam at home during the COVID-19 pandemic
  * The comparison group took a proctored exam in the facilities of the university
* Data cleaning is conducted, removing students with minimal participation or achievement and students with internet problems
* The differences in content between the two courses and the exams are marginal

<h1> Methodology — <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"> Model </span> </h1>

<br>

Dissimilarities in the students event patterns (time of submission) for each task $j$  

$$d_j^L(v_{ij}, v_{i'j}) = \sum_{m=1}^{K=70} | v_{ijm} - v_{i'jm} |$$


* With 
  * time attribute $x = v$
  * Examination is divided into $m = 1, ... , 70$ time intervals
  * $v_{ijm}$ denotes the number of answers of student $i$ for task $j$ in the $m$-th interval
  * Manhatten metric is used

<h1> Methodology — <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"> Model </span> </h1>
  
<br>

Dissimilarities in points achieved for each task $j$  

$$d_j^P(s_{ij}, s_{i'j}) = |  s_{ij} - s_{i'j} |$$

* With 
  * point attribute $x = s$
  * $s_{ij}$ denotes the points achieved by student $i$ in the $j$-th subtask
  * Manhatten metric is used

<h1> Methodology — <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Full  Model </span> </h1>


$$D(s_i, s_{i'}, v_i, v_{i'}) = \dfrac{1}{h} \sum_{j=1}^h \left(w_j^P \cdot d_j^P (s_{ij}, s_{i'j}) + w_j^L \cdot d_j^L (v_{ij}, v_{i'j}) \right)$$

* Weights $w_j$ control the influence of each attribute on the global object dissimilarity
  * $\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^h w_j^P + w_j^L =1$

--

* We reduce the weights for
  * `R`-tasks, as these tasks have more noise
  * Essay questions, as the comparison on that kind of task are limited
  * Points achieved
  
--

* Since dissimilarity measures depend on scale, the attributes are **normalized**

# Discussion

* Three notable clusters (**A**, **B**, and **E**) consisting of two students each
* Collusion in larger groups are not found
* These results are also found with other linkage methods and parameter specifications as weightings
* The approach provides a basis for the examination of clusters based on comparison with a reference group
* The elevated risk of detection may indeed discourage students from cheating in unproctored exams 


---

# Further research 


* Investigating long-term effects of collusion analysis on student behavior 
  * Impact on academic integrity ?
  * Impact of AI on students collusion behavior? 
* Development of a (better) decision rule to classify conspicuous clusters



<!--
* Various hierarchical clustering algorithms exist
  * The data driven cophenetic correlation coefficient is used to assess the algorithms
  * Average linkage clustering most suitable 
* Dendrogram, providing a visual representation of the clustering results
* Notable clusters are further investigated with scatterplots and barcharts

* Comparison with the results from the comparison group supports the findings
* Method successfully detects at least three clusters with near identical exams
  * Independent of the linkage method used
* Important step in adapting to the progressing of digitization of education
* Equips us better for unforeseen situations in the future
  * E.g.: pandemics, climate change impacts
